How it Works
Locomotive Scroll is used to create a smooth scrolling effect. The page content is wrapped in a data-scroll-container element to allow for smooth page navigation.

GSAP and ScrollTrigger are used to animate elements as they come into view. The animations are triggered based on the scroll position, creating dynamic and engaging transitions.

Custom CSS has been used to style the page, making it responsive and visually aligned with the OBYS Agency website's theme.
